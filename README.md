# Simple-Dimensions
Minecraft mod that allows you to easily create new dimensions

## Changes from original:
+ Added support for any dimension type from any mod (Ex: The Nether, The End, Twilight Forest)
+ Fixed compatibility with Twilight Forest
+ Added various user feedback for commands and fixed /timed command
+ Force dimension deletion rather than wait and assume its completion (Fixes issue where dimensions never delete and command gives no error or feedback)
+ Allow deletion of a dimension with other players in it (Teleports them to thier spawn point in the overworld, or the overworlds spawnpoint)
+ Removes OpenComputers interface (Just adds bloat to the mod and isnt very usefull (can only list dimensions which really isn't very usefull anyway), It's supposed to be simple dimensions not bloated dimensions!)
